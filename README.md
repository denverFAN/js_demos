There are code examples on Javascript using jQuery, Google Maps Javascript API that I've implemented on the real projects:

<b>ajaxPagination</b> - simple self-written pagination for the page with multiple tabs and sortings. It needs optimization in future.

<b>createMarkersInfos</b> - creating/deleting multiple markers with Infowindows with form inside on the Google Map.
Input data can be transferred to controller via ajax and saved to DB. 

<b>showMarkersInfos</b> - showing multiple markers with Infowindows on the Google Map.

<b>editPolygons</b> - creating/editing existing polygons on the Google Map.

<b>usefulFunctions</b> - several useful functions.
